        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Leonardo. I am a curious person by nature. I like
          knowing how things work and enjoy learning. My family and I moved to
          the U.S. when I was 10 years old. I am what most people have come to
          know as a Dreamer and DACA Recepient. I am grateful for the challenges
          and barriers that I have experienced in my life because they ground me
          to the shared struggle of those around me. The struggle to overcome
          adversity in itself can provide an opportunity to think critically
          about widely accepted norms and standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technology increasingly plays a larger role in how our social systems
          are implement and maintained. It is therefore of utmost important
          that, as these systems are created, we are able to think critically of
          the unintended impact these systems may have on communities whose
          lived experienced is often more complex than the systems we build.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have worked in social services for the past decade. I now look
          forward to making a transition into Technology where my hope is to
          contribute towards the innotivate technologies that are inclusive of
          the diverse tapestry of our communities.
